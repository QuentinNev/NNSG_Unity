# NNSG_Unity
NNSG integrated to Unity

## Project structure
To clearly seperate assets inside the **Assets** folder, folders are prefixed with an underscore to make them appear on top of the list. This way we can clearly see what's our content and what's coming from imported assets. We could move / rename those assets but if we need to reimport them Unity will place them at the root of **Assets** folder.
